The Warden is a secure delivery system for content like images and downloadable videos. It consists of two layers:

  * A bit of code which generates secure tokens which are passed as url parameters or cookies. This code is provided in both PHP and Java implementations.
  * Apache mod\_python script and a Java servlet that performs ticket cracking and authorization.

This project is currently in placeholder status. Kink.com is donating the working/proven code to open source. Code will follow soon.
